# List-and-Dictionaries-
We are going to study how to use list and Dictionaries in python
A python program always works on the basis of objects handling. Instructions (whether they are defined in a free code, in a if statement or in a loop while or for) are always executed on objects. Variables as discussed before represent a particular type of objects in python. But in a general way, instructions in a python program are defined from a collection of objects which comes in different forms of sequences of values. These sequences of values can be made for example by a set of variables with unique value. That finally means that a variable defined from a single value is not generally sufficient to form the architecture of a program. In python, we have:

An object list is a sequence of values (numerical and /or characters) indexed and
specified inside brackets, separated by commas. Example : ```python x = [ 1 , 5 , 8, 10 ,4 , 50, 8 ] # List that only contains numbers y = ["Olivier","ENGEL","Strasbourg"] # List that only contains characters z = [1, "Olivier",5 , 8, "ENGEL",10, 4, 50, "Strasbourg"] # List that contains numbers and characters
